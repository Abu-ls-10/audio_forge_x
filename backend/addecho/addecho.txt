NAME
       addecho - Add echo effect to a mono WAV sound file

SYNOPSIS
       addecho [-d delay] [-v volume_scale] sourcewav destwav

DESCRIPTION
       addecho is a versatile command-line utility designed for enhancing mono WAV sound files by adding an echo effect. Utilizing addecho, users can seamlessly integrate echo effects into sound files, enriching auditory experience with depth and dimension. The echo effect is created by mixing a delayed and scaled version of the original sound with the original sound itself. By applying precise delay and volume scaling parameters, users have full control over the timing and intensity of the echo effect, ensuring optimal customization to suit their creative vision. 

       Key features of addecho include: 
       - Flexible parameter customization: Users can specify the delay and volume scaling parameters through simple command-line options, tailoring the echo effect to meet their exact requirements. 
       - Seamless integration: addecho seamlessly integrates into existing workflows, allowing users to apply echo effects to mono WAV sound files with ease. Whether enhancing music, voice recordings, or sound effects, addecho delivers consistent and reliable results. 
       - Comprehensive compatibility: Designed to support mono WAV sound files with a sampling rate of 22050, addecho ensures compatibility with a wide range of audio sources. This enables users to apply echo effects to various sound files without compatibility issues.
       - Efficient processing: With addecho, users can efficiently process large sound files, thanks to its optimized performance and memory management. This enables smooth execution even when working with extensive audio projects. 

       Overall, addecho empowers users to unleash their creativity and elevate their audio projects with captivating echo effects. Whether adding depth to music tracks, creating immersive soundscapes, or enhancing voice recordings, addecho is the go-to solution for audio enthusiasts and professionals alike.

       The options are explained below:
    
       -d delay       
              Specifies the delay parameter for the echo effect, representing the number of samples to wait before introducing the echoing copy of the sound. The delay is a positive integer specified in samples, where a delay of N samples corresponds to a delay of N / 22050 seconds, where 22050 is the sampling rate of WAV files. The default delay is 8000 samples.

       -v volume_scale	
              Sets the volume scale parameter for the echo effect, indicating the degree to which the volume of the echoing copy is reduced relative to the original sound. The default volume scale is 4.

       sourcewav 	
              The path to the source WAV audio file. 

       destwav 	
              The path to the destination WAV audio file where the echo- modified sound will be saved.

RETURN VALUES
       The addecho program returns the following exit status codes:
       - 0: Successful execution.
       - 1: An error occurred during execution.

EXAMPLES
       - To add an echo effect with a delay of 8000 samples and a volume scale of 4 to the source file "sound.wav" and save the result as "sound_with_echo.wav", use the following command:
           addecho -d 8000 -v 4 sound.wav sound_with_echo.wav

       - To add an echo effect with a delay of 12000 samples and a volume scale of 2 to the source file "music.wav" and save the result as "music_with_echo.wav", use the following command:
           addecho -d 12000 -v 2 music.wav music_with_echo.wav

       - To add an echo effect with default delay and volume scale to the source file "door.wav" and save the result as "door_echo.wav", use the following command:
           addecho door.wav door_echo.wav


WARNINGS
       The addecho program may fail or produce unexpected results under the following conditions:
       - The source WAV file is not found or cannot be opened for reading.
       - The destination WAV file cannot be created or opened for writing.
       - Memory allocation fails when creating the echo buffer.
       - The value of delay is not positive.
       - The volume_scale value is not positive.
       - Compatibility with mono WAV format: The addecho program is specifically designed for mono WAV sound files with a sampling rate of 22050. Attempting to process sound files in other formats or with different sampling rates may result in errors or incorrect echo effects.
